This is my Landing Page project assigned by the foundations section of the Odin Project. Using HTML, CSS, and Flexbox, this project displays all of the skills I've learned in the course up until this point. I coded this on a 1920 x 1080 screen so the resolutions may be off on other devices since I have not gotten to the part where I can fix that yet  and some of my flexbox items aren't necessarily perfect. I plan on coming back and fixing it in the future when I have learnt it, but for now I will move on from this project and continue with the Odin Project curriculum.
